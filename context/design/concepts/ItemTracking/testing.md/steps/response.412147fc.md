# test: ItemTracking

## Setup
    // Initialize a new ItemTracking system for testing.
    // User and Item types are assumed to be comparable, e.g., strings or unique identifiers.
    let system = new ItemTracking<string, string>();
    let userA = "UserAlpha";
    let userB = "UserBeta";
    let item1 = "ItemOne";
    let item2 = "ItemTwo";
    let item3 = "ItemThree";

## Query Definition for Testing
    // For the purpose of these tests, a `getTrackedItems` query is assumed to verify state:
    // query getTrackedItems (user: User): set of Items
    //    requires a UserRecord exists for user
    //    effects returns the set of items associated with the user

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: addUserRecord - Successfully adds a new user
    // Pre-condition: UserA does not have a UserRecord in the system.
    // Action: Create a UserRecord for UserA.
    system.addUserRecord(userA);
    // Post-condition: UserA's UserRecord exists and tracks an empty set of items.
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userA) is empty set;

### Test Case 2: addUserRecord - Fails when UserRecord for user already exists (requires violation)
    // Pre-condition: UserA already has a UserRecord (from Test Case 1).
    // Action: Attempt to create another UserRecord for UserA.
    // Expected: Action fails due to the 'requires' condition.
    expect_failure system.addUserRecord(userA) with reason "no UserRecord already for user already exists";

### Test Case 3: addItem - Successfully adds a first item to a user
    // Pre-condition: UserA exists and tracks no items.
    // Action: UserA starts tracking Item1.
    system.addItem(userA, item1);
    // Post-condition: UserA's UserRecord now tracks {Item1}.
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userA) is {item1};

### Test Case 4: addItem - Successfully adds a second item to the same user
    // Pre-condition: UserA tracks {Item1}.
    // Action: UserA starts tracking Item2.
    system.addItem(userA, item2);
    // Post-condition: UserA's UserRecord now tracks {Item1, Item2}.
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userA) is {item1, item2};

### Test Case 5: addItem - Fails when item is already in user's set of items (requires violation)
    // Pre-condition: UserA tracks {Item1, Item2}, so Item1 is already tracked.
    // Action: Attempt to add Item1 to UserA's tracked items again.
    // Expected: Action fails due to the 'requires' condition.
    expect_failure system.addItem(userA, item1) with reason "item is not already in that user's set of items";

### Test Case 6: addItem - Fails when UserRecord does not exist for user (requires violation)
    // Pre-condition: UserB does not have a UserRecord in the system.
    // Action: Attempt to add Item3 to UserB's tracked items.
    // Expected: Action fails due to the 'requires' condition.
    expect_failure system.addItem(userB, item3) with reason "a UserRecord exists for user";

### Test Case 7: removeItem - Successfully removes an item from a user's tracked set
    // Pre-condition: UserA tracks {Item1, Item2}.
    // Action: UserA stops tracking Item1.
    system.removeItem(userA, item1);
    // Post-condition: UserA's UserRecord now tracks {Item2}.
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userA) is {item2};

### Test Case 8: removeItem - Successfully removes the last item from a user's tracked set
    // Pre-condition: UserA tracks {Item2}.
    // Action: UserA stops tracking Item2.
    system.removeItem(userA, item2);
    // Post-condition: UserA's UserRecord tracks an empty set of items.
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userA) is empty set;

### Test Case 9: removeItem - Fails when item is not in user's set of items (requires violation)
    // Pre-condition: UserA tracks an empty set of items. Item3 is not tracked by UserA.
    // Action: Attempt to remove Item3 from UserA's tracked items.
    // Expected: Action fails due to the 'requires' condition.
    expect_failure system.removeItem(userA, item3) with reason "item is in user's set of items";

### Test Case 10: removeItem - Fails when UserRecord does not exist for user (requires violation)
    // Pre-condition: UserB does not have a UserRecord in the system.
    // Action: Attempt to remove Item1 from UserB's tracked items.
    // Expected: Action fails due to the 'requires' condition.
    expect_failure system.removeItem(userB, item1) with reason "a UserRecord exists for user";

### Test Case 11: Multiple Users and Independent Tracking
    // Pre-condition: Reset the system to ensure a clean state for this multi-user scenario.
    system = new ItemTracking();
    // Action: Add UserA and UserB records.
    system.addUserRecord(userA);
    system.addUserRecord(userB);

    // Action: UserA tracks Item1 and Item2. UserB tracks Item1.
    system.addItem(userA, item1);
    system.addItem(userA, item2);
    system.addItem(userB, item1); // UserB tracking Item1 is independent of UserA

    // Post-condition: Verify both users' states are correct and distinct.
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userA) is {item1, item2};
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userB) is {item1};

    // Action: UserA stops tracking Item1.
    system.removeItem(userA, item1);
    // Post-condition: Verify UserA's state changed, but UserB's state is unaffected.
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userA) is {item2};
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userB) is {item1}; // UserB still tracks Item1

    // Action: UserB starts tracking Item3.
    system.addItem(userB, item3);
    // Post-condition: Verify UserB's state changed, and UserA's state remains unchanged.
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userB) is {item1, item3};
    assert system.getTrackedItems(userA) is {item2};
