Now, analyze the following Concept Specification and generate the API documentation based on these instructions.

**concept** SportsStats\[Source, Stat, Data]\
**purpose** store team statistics in a structured way, where each sport defines which stats are tracked and which are considered key\
**principle** each sport defines a set of stats relevant to it (with some marked as key); teams belonging to that sport inherit those stat types and maintain their own current values\
**state**\
       a set of TeamStats with ...\
             a name String\
             a Sport\
       a set of Sports with ...\
             a name String\
             a Source\
             a KeyStats set of Stats\
       a set of StatValues with
             a teamStatId TeamStats
             a sportId Sport
             a statId Stat
             a value Data
**actions**\
       addTeam (teamname: String, sport: Sport): (teamStats: TeamStat)\
             **requires** no TeamStats for this teamname with this sport already exists\
             **effects** creates a new TeamStats for this teamname for sport\
       removeTeam (teamname: String, sport: Sport): (teamStats: TeamStat)\
             **requires** TeamStats for this teamname with this sport exists\
             **effects** removes TeamStats for this teamname for sport\
       addSport (sportName: String, source: Source, default: Set of Stats): (sport: Sport)\
             **requires** no Sport with this name exists\
             **effects** creates a new Sport with this source with KeyStats set as default\
       deleteSport (sportName: String): (sport: Sport)\
             **requires** Sport with this name exists and no teams associated with the sport exists\
             **effects** removes sportname from state\
       addKeyStat (sportName: String, stat: Stat):\
             **requires** Sport with this name exists and stat is not already in its KeyStats\
             **effects** adds stat to sportName's KeyStats\
       removeKeyStat (sportName: String, stat: Stat):\
             **requires** Sport with this name exists and stat is in its KeyStats\
             **effects** removes stat from sportName's KeyStats\
       fetchTeamStats (teamname: String, sport: Sport): (keyStatsData: Map\<Stat, Data>)\
             **requires** TeamStat for this teamname and sport exists\
             **effects** for each KeyStat in sport's KeyStats, fetches Data for this specific team from the concept's internal StatValues
        system setStatValue (teamname: String, sport: Sport, statId: Stat, value: Data):\
             **requires** a TeamStats entry for the given teamname and sport must exist.
             **effects** either creates a new StatValue entry or updates an existing one for the specified team, sport, and stat

**notes**: Actual statistical data is stored internally by the concept (e.g., via syncs that populate values from each sport’s Source). The concept itself defines the structure and relationships but relies on these syncs or system actions to update stat values.
