# Specification: Password Authentication System (PasswordAuth)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a robust and secure Password Authentication System (PasswordAuth). Its primary purpose is to provide users with a secure method to register, log in, and manage their account credentials within an application.

## 2. Goals

* Provide a secure and reliable mechanism for user authentication.
* Protect user passwords and sensitive account information.
* Offer a seamless user experience for registration, login, and password management.
* Be resilient against common attack vectors (e.g., brute-force, credential stuffing).

## 3. Actors

* **User:** An individual who wishes to register, log in, or manage their password.
* **System (Authentication Service):** The backend service responsible for managing user accounts, authenticating credentials, and issuing session tokens.
* **External Email Service:** For sending verification and password reset emails.

## 4. Functional Requirements (Use Cases)

### 4.1. User Registration (Account Creation)

**Description:** Allows new users to create an account by providing an identifier and a password.

* **FR.REG.1:** The system SHALL provide a mechanism for users to register with a unique identifier (e.g., email address or username) and a password.
* **FR.REG.2:** The system SHALL require users to confirm their password during registration.
* **FR.REG.3:** The system SHALL enforce a strong password policy (see **FR.SEC.6**).
* **FR.REG.4:** The system SHALL validate the uniqueness of the identifier. If the identifier is already in use, the system SHALL return an appropriate error.
* **FR.REG.5:** Upon successful registration, the system SHALL store the user's identifier and a securely hashed password.
* **FR.REG.6 (Optional but Recommended):** The system SHALL send a verification email to the provided email address, containing a unique, time-limited link or code.
* **FR.REG.7 (Optional but Recommended):** The user account SHALL remain unverified or have limited functionality until email verification is complete.
* **FR.REG.8:** The system SHALL provide clear success or error messages to the user.

### 4.2. User Login

**Description:** Allows registered users to authenticate and gain access to the application.

* **FR.LOGIN.1:** The system SHALL provide a mechanism for users to log in using their registered identifier and password.
* **FR.LOGIN.2:** The system SHALL compare the provided password against the stored password hash.
* **FR.LOGIN.3:** If the credentials match and the account is active/verified, the system SHALL generate and return a secure session token (e.g., JWT, session cookie) to the user.
* **FR.LOGIN.4:** If the credentials do not match, or the account is locked/inactive/unverified, the system SHALL return a generic "Invalid credentials" error message (see **FR.SEC.4**).
* **FR.LOGIN.5:** The system SHALL implement brute-force protection mechanisms (see **FR.SEC.3**).
* **FR.LOGIN.6:** The system SHALL record the timestamp of the last successful login.

### 4.3. Password Reset (Forgot Password)

**Description:** Allows users who have forgotten their password to regain access to their account.

* **FR.RESET.1:** The system SHALL provide a "Forgot Password" mechanism where users can submit their registered identifier (email/username).
* **FR.RESET.2:** Upon receiving a valid identifier, the system SHALL send a time-limited, single-use password reset link or code to the user's registered email address.
* **FR.RESET.3:** The system SHALL *not* indicate whether the identifier exists in the system to prevent enumeration attacks (e.g., always show a "If an account exists..." message).
* **FR.RESET.4:** The password reset link/code SHALL expire after a configurable duration (e.g., 15-60 minutes).
* **FR.RESET.5:** The password reset link/code SHALL become invalid after one successful use.
* **FR.RESET.6:** Upon accessing the reset link/submitting the code, the system SHALL allow the user to set a new password, subject to password policy (see **FR.SEC.6**).
* **FR.RESET.7:** The system SHALL invalidate all existing user sessions upon a successful password reset.
* **FR.RESET.8:** The system SHALL notify the user via email that their password has been changed.

### 4.4. Password Change (Logged-in User)

**Description:** Allows logged-in users to change their password.

* **FR.CHANGE.1:** The system SHALL provide a mechanism for a logged-in user to change their password.
* **FR.CHANGE.2:** The user SHALL be required to provide their current password for verification.
* **FR.CHANGE.3:** The user SHALL be required to provide and confirm their new password, subject to password policy (see **FR.SEC.6**).
* **FR.CHANGE.4:** If the current password is correct and the new password meets policy, the system SHALL update the stored password hash.
* **FR.CHANGE.5:** The system SHALL invalidate all existing user sessions upon a successful password change.
* **FR.CHANGE.6:** The system SHALL notify the user via email that their password has been changed.

### 4.5. Session Management

**Description:** How user sessions are managed post-authentication.

* **FR.SESSION.1:** Upon successful login, the system SHALL issue a secure session token (e.g., JWT, opaque token, secure cookie).
* **FR.SESSION.2:** Session tokens SHALL have a defined expiration time.
* **FR.SESSION.3:** The system SHALL provide a "Logout" mechanism to invalidate the current user's session token.
* **FR.SESSION.4:** The system SHALL allow for session revocation, triggered by password changes or administrative actions.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1. Data Model (Illustrative)

* **User Table:**
  * `id` (UUID/INT, Primary Key)
  * `email` (VARCHAR, Unique, Indexed) OR `username` (VARCHAR, Unique, Indexed)
  * `password_hash` (VARCHAR)
  * `password_salt` (VARCHAR - if separate salt used)
  * `is_verified` (BOOLEAN, default FALSE)
  * `is_active` (BOOLEAN, default TRUE)
  * `failed_login_attempts` (INT, default 0)
  * `lockout_until` (DATETIME, NULLABLE)
  * `created_at` (DATETIME)
  * `updated_at` (DATETIME)
  * `last_login_at` (DATETIME, NULLABLE)
* **PasswordResetToken Table:**
  * `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
  * `user_id` (UUID/INT, Foreign Key to User.id)
  * `token` (VARCHAR, Unique, Indexed)
  * `expires_at` (DATETIME)
  * `is_used` (BOOLEAN, default FALSE)
  * `created_at` (DATETIME)
* **EmailVerificationToken Table (if applicable):**
  * Similar to PasswordResetToken table.

### 5.2. Password Storage

* **TR.PASS.1:** Passwords SHALL never be stored in plaintext.
* **TR.PASS.2:** Passwords SHALL be hashed using a cryptographically strong, adaptive one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., Argon2, bcrypt, scrypt).
* **TR.PASS.3:** A unique, cryptographically secure salt SHALL be generated and used for each password hash. The salt SHALL be stored alongside the hash.
* **TR.PASS.4:** The hashing algorithm SHALL be configured with sufficient work factors (iterations/memory/parallelism) to be computationally expensive (e.g., bcrypt cost factor >= 12).

### 5.3. API Endpoints (Illustrative RESTful)

* `POST /auth/register`
* `POST /auth/login`
* `POST /auth/logout`
* `POST /auth/forgot-password`
* `POST /auth/reset-password`
* `POST /auth/change-password` (requires authentication)
* `GET /auth/verify-email?token={token}` (if email verification is used)

### 5.4. Communication

* **TR.COMM.1:** All communication between the client and the authentication service SHALL be secured using HTTPS/TLS 1.2 or higher.

## 6. Security Considerations (Non-Functional Requirements)

* **FR.SEC.1 (HTTPS/TLS):** All communication must use HTTPS/TLS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
* **FR.SEC.2 (Password Hashing & Salting):** See **TR.PASS.1, TR.PASS.2, TR.PASS.3**.
* **FR.SEC.3 (Brute-Force Protection):**
  * The system SHALL implement rate limiting on login attempts per IP address and/or per account identifier.
  * The system SHALL implement temporary account lockout after a configurable number of consecutive failed login attempts (e.g., 5 attempts in 5 minutes leading to 30-minute lockout).
  * The system SHALL use varying response times for valid/invalid credentials to prevent timing attacks (e.g., constant time for credential validation).
* **FR.SEC.4 (Generic Error Messages):** Error messages for failed login or password reset attempts SHALL be generic (e.g., "Invalid credentials", "Password reset link sent") to prevent user enumeration attacks.
* **FR.SEC.5 (Session Security):**
  * Session tokens SHALL be stored securely (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure cookies for web, secure storage for mobile).
  * Session tokens SHALL have a reasonable expiration time and be refreshable if needed.
  * Session tokens SHALL be protected against XSS and CSRF attacks (e.g., using CSRF tokens for state-changing requests, `SameSite` cookie attribute).
* **FR.SEC.6 (Password Policy):** The system SHALL enforce a strong password policy, including but not limited to:
  * Minimum length (e.g., 12 characters).
  * Inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
  * Disallow common or easily guessable passwords (e.g., via a blacklist).
  * Disallow use of parts of the username/email in the password.
  * Password history check (prevent reuse of last X passwords).
* **FR.SEC.7 (Account Lockout/Deactivation):** The system SHALL provide mechanisms to temporarily or permanently lock/deactivate user accounts.
* **FR.SEC.8 (Security Logging & Monitoring):** The system SHALL log security-relevant events (e.g., successful logins, failed login attempts, password changes, account lockouts) for auditing and intrusion detection.
* **FR.SEC.9 (Email Verification):** If used, email verification SHALL ensure that the registered email address belongs to the user, reducing the risk of account takeovers from incorrect emails.

## 7. Error Handling

* **NFR.ERROR.1:** The API SHALL return standardized error codes and clear, developer-friendly messages for different failure scenarios (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 409 Conflict, 429 Too Many Requests).
* **NFR.ERROR.2:** User-facing error messages SHALL be clear, concise, and helpful, guiding the user towards a resolution without revealing sensitive information.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR.PERF.1 (Performance):** Login and registration operations SHALL complete within 500ms under typical load.
* **NFR.SCALE.1 (Scalability):** The system SHALL be designed to handle a large number of concurrent users and scale horizontally.
* **NFR.AVAIL.1 (Availability):** The authentication service SHALL maintain an uptime of at least 99.9%.
* **NFR.MAINT.1 (Maintainability):** The codebase shall be well-documented, modular, and easy to maintain and extend.
* **NFR.AUDIT.1 (Auditability):** All critical authentication events SHALL be logged for auditing purposes.

## 9. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for Initial Version)

* **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA):** Support for TOTP, SMS, Email OTP, or FIDO2/WebAuthn.
* **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Integration with identity providers like OAuth2/OIDC.
* **Social Login:** Integration with Google, Facebook, Apple, etc.
* **"Remember Me" Functionality:** Persistent sessions for a longer duration.
* **Session Management UI:** Allow users to view and revoke active sessions.
* **CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA:** To mitigate automated attacks.
* **Admin Panel:** Functionality for administrators to manage user accounts (e.g., reset passwords, lock/unlock accounts).
