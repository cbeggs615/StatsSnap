I revised the PasswordAuth concept to address lifecycle gaps from Assignment 2. Specifically, I added the deleteAccount and changePassword actions to provide a more complete user lifecycle, from registration and authentication through account removal or password updates. When I later introduced password hashing, the implementation’s state changed slightly to include derived hash data, salts, and parameters; however, this refinement remains internal to the implementation and does not affect the conceptual specification, which still consists of a username and password association.

The implementation process went smoothly overall. Context, along with some manual adjustments and assistance from another LLM, helped produce a robust implementation aligned with the revised specification. Initially, the password was stored as a plain string, but after confirming that the `node:crypto` module could be used, I updated the implementation to hash passwords securely. The implementation was also where queries were added such as how to get a user and also a query that can check if a password matches the input.

I struggled with testing again. While context was able to generate a useful starting set of test scenarios, I had to refine them to run properly with Deno’s testing framework and to ensure they reflected realistic user journeys and edge cases. The final tests effectively capture both the normal lifecycle of the concept and its boundary conditions. Also, was happy when the tests still worked after changing the implementation to use hashing.
